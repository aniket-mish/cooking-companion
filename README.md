## Introduction

Stacked is a side project that I am working on. It's an app that recommends tv shows and movies. I always struggle to find something to watch at leisure. Stacked is a search engine. It finds movies and tv shows based on your mood, similar to "Just ask siri" in apple music.

A blog post by [vboykis](https://twitter.com/vboykis), [retro on viberary](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/01/05/retro-on-viberary/) inspired me to build this project. I am building it to solidify my understanding of a production-grade system. I aim to build it end to end with clean code. 

In this project, I will build a transformer-based machine learning system.
