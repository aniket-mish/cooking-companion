# Stacked

Stacked is a side project that I am working on. It's an app that recommends books.

I followed the development of viberary, which is a project by @vboykis in 2023, and recently read her blog post [retro on viberary](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/01/05/retro-on-viberary/), that inspired me to build something similar. The project has to be something you're interested in, and I have been fortunate enough to work on real-world recommender systems. This project will teach me a lot about search and recsys and production systems in general.

In this project, I will build a transformer-based machine learning system.
