# Stacked

Stacked is a side project that I am working on. It's an app that recommends books.

I followed the development of viberary, which is a project by @vboykis in 2023, and recently read her blog post [retro on viberary](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/01/05/retro-on-viberary/), that inspired me to build something similar. This is me building the same stuff (maybe a different tech stack) to solidify my understanding of a production-grade system. 

In this project, I will build a transformer-based machine learning system.
