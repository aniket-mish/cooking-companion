# Stacked

Stacked is a side project that I am working on. It's an app that recommends tv shows and movies.

In 2023, I followed and enjoyed the development of Viberary, a project by [vboykis](https://twitter.com/vboykis). Her blog post [retro on viberary](https://vickiboykis.com/2024/01/05/retro-on-viberary/) inspired me to build something similar. I am building stacked to solidify my understanding of a production-grade system.

In this project, I will build a transformer-based machine learning system.
